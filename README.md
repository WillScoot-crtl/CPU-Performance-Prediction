The files linked are the contents to my final project for MATH 582, Computational Data Science. As an overview, this projects covers the design of multi linear regression on CPU performance using open sourced data gathered on the UCI Reposistory website. The process contained preprocessing, backwards elimination, and fitting to a linear regression model. The program was written in python using pandas, numpy, scikit learn, and matplotlib for cleaning, preprocessing, numerical manipulation, fitting, and visualizing. A report is attached in this repository which goes more in depth over all the design process with the components listed above.
